The IndyGo Ridership Dashboard is a dynamic visualization platform created for IndyGo, the public transit agency serving Indianapolis. It delivers actionable insights into both historical and real-time ridership data, helping planners, policymakers, and the community understand how transit services are being used. By doing so, it supports smarter service planning, more efficient resource allocation, and an improved rider experience.

Our dashboard was built to answer the following key questions about IndyGo ridership:

1. What is the total ridership across different time scales (day, week, month, year)?

2. How does ridership vary across different route categories, such as high-frequency routes, rapid transit, and coverage services?

3. What are the ridership trends for specific routes over the past 12 months?

4. How do ridership levels change across different time frames, including monthly, by bid period, or over rolling five-week windows?

5. What are the changes in ridership over time, such as month-to-month, year-over-year, or week-to-week?

6. Which stops experience the highest and lowest ridership, and how can these insights inform resource allocation?
